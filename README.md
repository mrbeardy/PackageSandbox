# PackageSandbox

This repository is a unity project that will be used as the base for developing
Unity Packages.

It will contain varius different games that can be used as tests for the various
Unity packages planned for development, such as the Inventory System, Health
System, etc.

Ideally, it should contain different genres of games, for both 2D and 3D, to
give a wide enough scope for testing the different packages in different
environments.
